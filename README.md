# collatz-conjecture
A simple program referencing Collatz conjecture written in Clojure.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: 
start with any positive integer n. 

Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
